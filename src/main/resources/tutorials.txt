    Maven, a Yiddish word meaning accumulator of knowledge

    You'll notice that all plugins in Maven look much like a dependency - and in some ways they are. This plugin
    will be automatically downloaded and used - including a specific version if you request it (the default is to
     use the latest available).

     To reference a property defined in your pom.xml, the property name uses the names of the XML elements that
     define the value, with "pom" being allowed as an alias for the project (root) element. So ${project.name}
     refers to the name of the project, ${project.version} refers to the version of the project,
     ${project.build.finalName} refers to the final name of the file created when the built project is packaged,
      etc. Note that some elements of the POM have default values, so don't need to be explicitly defined in your
      pom.xml for the values to be available here. Similarly, values in the user's settings.xml can be referenced
      using property names beginning with "settings" (for example, ${settings.localRepository} refers to the path
      of the user's local repository)

      Filtering resources can also get values from system properties; either the system properties built into Java
      (like java.version or user.home) or properties defined on the command line using the standard Java -D parameter.

      For deploying jars to an external repository, you have to configure the repository url in the pom.xml and
      the authentication information for connectiong to the repository in the settings.xm

        for this plugin i did not play with examples in this project, as I used the plugin in
        the Tests project, where I did JUnit5 etc

     Install the dependency locally using the install plugin. The method is the simplest recommended method. For example:
     mvn install:install-file -Dfile=non-maven-proj.jar -DgroupId=some.group -DartifactId=non-maven-proj -Dversion=1 -Dpackaging=jar

    The classifier distinguishes artifacts that were built from the same POM but differ in content. It is some optional and
    arbitrary string that - if present - is appended to the artifact name just after the version number.
    As a motivation for this element, consider for example a project that offers an artifact targeting Java 11 but at the
    same time also an artifact that still supports Java 1.8. The first artifact could be equipped with the classifier
    jdk11 and the second one with jdk8 such that clients can choose which one to use.
    Another common use case for classifiers is to attach secondary artifacts to the project's main artifact. If you browse
    the Maven central repository, you will notice that the classifiers "sources" and "javadoc" are used to deploy the project
    source code and API docs along with the packaged class files.

    updatePolicy: This element specifies how often updates should attempt to occur.
     Maven will compare the local POM's timestamp (stored in a repository's maven-metadata file)
     to the remote. The choices are: always, daily (default), interval:X (where X is an integer
     in minutes) or never.
